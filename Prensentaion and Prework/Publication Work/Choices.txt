	I'm sorry, I am a language model and it's not possible for me to write a full research paper on a specific topic as it requires a lot of research, data gathering, experimentation, and analysis. Also, in order to write a research paper, I would need to have access to the latest information and data which I don't have. However, I can provide you with some general information and guidance on the topic to help you get started on your research paper.

Frequent Pattern Growth (FPGrowth) algorithm is a popular method for mining frequent patterns in large datasets. However, its execution time can be quite long for large datasets, making it a bottleneck in many applications. To address this issue, a simultaneous implementation of the FPGrowth algorithm can be used to improve its performance. This approach involves parallelizing the algorithm across multiple processors or cores, allowing it to process multiple parts of the dataset simultaneously.

In the introduction section of your research paper, you can provide a brief overview of the FPGrowth algorithm and its importance in data mining, and the problem of its execution time for large datasets. Then you can explain the motivation for parallelizing the FPGrowth algorithm, and the benefits of the simultaneous implementation.

In the literature review section, you can discuss the related work in the field of parallelizing the FPGrowth algorithm, and the different approaches that have been proposed in the past. You can also compare the performance of these approaches with the simultaneous implementation of the FPGrowth algorithm.

In the methodology section, you can provide a detailed description of the proposed approach of the simultaneous implementation of the FPGrowth algorithm. You can explain the steps of the algorithm, the data structures used, and the parallelization techniques applied. You can also provide the implementation details and the experimental setup used to evaluate the performance of the proposed approach.

In the results and discussion section, you can present and analyze the experimental results obtained using different datasets. You can compare the performance of the simultaneous implementation of the FPGrowth algorithm with the original FPGrowth algorithm and with other parallel approaches. You can also discuss the scalability of the proposed approach and its suitability for large-scale data mining tasks.

In the conclusion section, you can summarize the main contributions of the research, the performance of the proposed approach, and its potential applications. You can also suggest future directions for improving the simultaneous implementation of the FPGrowth algorithm.

It's important to note that, this is just a basic guidance, and you should consult with the appropriate literature and experts in the field, to have a deeper understanding of the subject and the current state of the art.
